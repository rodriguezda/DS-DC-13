# Project Design Writeup and Approval Template

### Project Problem and Hypothesis
Well-articulated problem statement with "specific aim" and hypothesis, based on your lightning talk

'''My goal is to take 2016 YTD NYC Airbnb renter/rentee data and use it create a model for identifying which properties are "Hot", as in, which properties can be labeled as top-rented properities, and identify the attributes that make them that.

My hypothesis based on the lightning talk is that, most of the hot-sellers are properties that on average, have less than 10 days availability per month. At this time, I have not identified any other relevant attributes that help increase my confidence level.'''   


### Datasets
An outline of any potential methods and models
'''
Detailed explanation of extant data available (ie: build a data dictionary or link to pre-built data dictionaries)
Describe any outstanding questions, assumptions, risks, caveats
Define your goals and criteria, in order to explain what success looks like

### Domain knowledge
* What experience do you already have around this area? Include specific features or relevant benchmarks from similar projects
'''none. I've never created a model for airbnb data or residential data. but, i can say that this feature, "top-sellers," is an active symbol on the airbnb site. they indicate "hot" properties with a lightning bolt. I can cross reference my findings by comparing to the actual results on the site.'''

### Project Problem and Hypothesis
* What's the project about? What problem are you solving?
'''There's a lot to be learned qualitatively and quantitatively from properties that are profiting the most, or  have no way of rewarding 
* Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?
* What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?

### Datasets
* Description of data set available, at the field level (see table)
* If from an API, include a sample return (this is usually included in API documentation!) (if doing this in markdown, use the javacription code tag)

### Domain knowledge
* What experience do you already have around this area?
* Does it relate or help inform the project in any way?
* What other research efforts exist?
    * Use a quick Google search to see what approaches others have made, or talk with your colleagues if it is work related about previous attempts at similar problems.
   
### Project Concerns
* What questions do you have about your project? What are you not sure you quite yet understand? (The more honest you are about this, the easier your instructors can help).
* What are the assumptions and caveats to the problem?
    * What data do you not have access to but wish you had?
    * What is already implied about the observations in your data set? For example, if your primary data set is twitter data, it may not be representative of the whole sample (say, predicting who would win an election)
* What are the risks to the project?
    * What's the cost of your model being wrong? (What's the benefit of your model being right?)
    * Is any of the data incorrect? Could it be incorrect?

### Outcomes
* What do you expect the output to look like?
* What does your target audience expect the output to look like?
* What gain do you expect from your most important feature on its own?
* How complicated does your model have to be?
* How successful does your project have to be in order to be considered a "success"?
* What will you do if the project is a bust (this happens! but it shouldn't here)?
